Overview
========

Given a list of cinema showings, find an a way to see the more possible different movies.


Algo and techno
===============

This project is a pretext to play a bit with different OR technics
Currently, linear programming is used, through the modeler Pulp.

Installation
============

Requires python Pulp, and a PL solver accepted by Pulp (eg: Glpk)
The file autogen.sh could be adaptated and used for this purpose

TODO
====

- Write actual tests
- Document the mathematical model used
- See if we should take into account the time from a cinema to another, and how
- See if we should add other objectives (eg: minimize the time between the beginning of the first and the end of the last showing)
- Try to play with constraint programming
